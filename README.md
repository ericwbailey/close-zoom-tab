# Close Zoom Tab

This extension will automatically close your browser tab after Zoom opens.

## How to use

Load this as an unpacked extension in your browser of choice. Target [the child Source/ folder](https://github.com/ericwbailey/close-zoom-tab/tree/master/src), and not the parent repo folder.

Currently, this extension only supports browsers that support the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format.
