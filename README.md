# Close Zoom Tab

This extension will automatically close your browser tab after Zoom opens.

## How to use

Load this as an unpacked extension in your browser of choice. Target [the child Source/ folder](https://github.com/ericwbailey/remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline/tree/master/Source), and not the parent repo folder.

Currently, this extension only supports browsers that support the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format.

Click the extension's icon to remove board movement events. Click again to restore them. Neat!
